# SnowRunner Vanilla++

This mod was created to address the feelings of "I'd love to drive this truck more, but it can't pull this or carry that or gets stuck / tips over too often" that you get as you progress through the game.

If you feel like half the trucks in your garage are just not worth using anymore by the time you reach Taymyr, you might be the target audience for this.

**Note:** While the primary goal of this mod isn't to make the game easier, that *will* happen as a side effect of the changes it makes. If you already find this game too easy, this mod is not for you.

# Normal Install

1. Grab the latest release from here: https://github.com/vsTerminus/SnowRunner/releases/latest

2. Download `initial.zip` and unpack it. Place `initial.pak` in `Steam/steamapps/common/SnowRunner/preload/paks/client/` and overwrite the original when prompted.

You will need to repeat this every time SnowRunner receives a patch, or if you ever have Steam validate the files (including moving the game to a new location). If you forget to do this and load up your profile, any modifications you made to your trucks that weren't possible in Vanilla will get reset.

If you decided to make a backup of the original initial.pak you should move it out of the "client" folder, as the game will attempt to load _all_ .pak files in this location, including your backup.

# Uninstall

Have Steam verify files. It will download a fresh copy of `initial.pak`.

# Manual Install (For Modders)

If you want to modify my files with your own changes, or just prefer to install things manually, here are the steps. **Regular Users can ignore these steps.**

In your `Steam/steamapps/common/SnowRunner/preload/paks/client/` directory you will find a file called `initial.pak`. Open it with **WinRAR**.

Yes, WinRAR. The short explanation is that other archive tools such as 7zip don't read Snowrunner .pak files correctly, or sometimes they can read and extract but cannot update them and that is what we need to do here. For whatever reason, WinRAR "just works" with SnowRunner's .pak files. Even on Linux, your best bet is to just install the Windows version of WinRAR using WINE, specifically wine-ge.

With `initial.pak` open, simply drag in the `[media]` folder from this repository and click OK. WinRAR will overwrite the existing files with the ones from this mod. When it finishes you can close WinRAR and launch SnowRunner as normal.

# General Changes

These are things that apply broadly across the game rather than to a specific truck.

## Fuel Rebalancing

I've rebalanced the tank size or fuel consumption rate of mostly every truck in the game. The starting point was the **"Fuel capacities based on real data" by ElfVierzhen** mod, but since that mod disappeared I have continued to balance new trucks and re-balance the old ones too.

The goal is that trucks should be able to drive for 30-50 minutes on a tank. Not 10 minutes like in vanilla, but also not for 6 hours like some of the trucks could after ElfVierzhen's changes.

I don't want fuel to be a completely irrelevant mechanic, just not something that you're forced to constantly think about. I want fuel trucks to be useful *sometimes*, not on every trip.

## Tire Rebalancing

I've also rebalanced (almost) all tires in the game. Again my starting point was the **"Actual Snow Chains" by ElfVierzhen** mod, but again I have continued to update new tires and rebalance old ones.

There are two goals here:

1. Tires shouldn't be artifically bad for "balance" reasons
2. All tires within a category should have the same stats. (ie, all mud tires perform the same, and which ones you pick is purely cosmetic preference)

For the most part I took the best tires from each category and then used that as a baseline. From there I boosted things like asphalt performance for mud tires where it made sense.

### All tires ignore ice

The only option the game provides is a true/false toggle for "ignore ice". Either tires ignore ice or they don't, and there's no in-between. I can't make tires "a bit better", it's all or nothing.

I could have made duplicates of tires and put them in the snow tires category but they wouldn't have been visually different and would just take up more space.

It made the most sense to me to simply have all tires ignore ice altogether.

## Camera Clipping Improvements

My mod includes the **"Camera Clipping Fix" by McKillem** mod.

https://mod.io/g/snowrunner/m/manual-camera-clipping-fix

This mod stops the camera from launching into the sky whenever it hits objects like telephone poles and watchtowers by removing the camera collision from them. It does not affect larger solid objects (like buildings). This is a really nice QoL thing I could not go back to playing without.

## All trucks purchaseable anywhere

Restricting truck purchases to specific regions was always dumb. There was nothing stopping you from just loading another map, buying the truck, and then going back. Removing this restriction just saves you time staring at loading screens.

Applies to all trucks in the game.

## Engine Power Rebalancing

Some of the engines (eg, "Russian Modern Scout" and "US Old Top") were just severely underpowered for the vehicles they were matched with.

I've tried to make sure that trucks can actually move under their own power, can climb a hill, and can pull a thing or two.

## Fuel Tank Rebalancing

In addition to not wanting players to need a fuel truck for every mission, one fuel truck should be enough to do the job. So I've improved the capacity of most fuel trailers/addons.

- "Fuel Tank" frame addon capacity increased from 1500 to 2500
- "Long Fuel Tank" frame addon capacity increased from 2800 to 4000
- "Tatra Fuel Tank" frame addon capacity increased to 2500
- "Crocodile Fuel Tank" frame addon capacity increased from 900 to 1500

## Farm Trailers can be packed on the towing frame

This change reduces the number of wheels required to make contact with the towing platform in order for the "Pack Trucks and Trailers" option to appear. The default is 4, this reduces it to 2. Packing the farm trailers is still sketchy as all hell and doesn't work *great*, but at least you can do it now.

# Truck-Specific Changes

These changes are made to affect a single truck. In most cases it will mean larger tire sizes  and the addition of or changes to AWD and Diff Lock. Sometimes there are additional engine options, additional frame addons, weighted bumpers, and new or modified suspension options as well.

For the smaller trucks, these changes aim to make them feel "viable" in late game and in DLC regions by giving them the things there doesn't seem to be a good reason for them *not* to have; Larger tires, taller suspension, more power, and sometimes room for more attachments where it makes sense and there is room.

In the case of the superheavies, they are already viable late game but many of them only get access to saddles and heavy cranes making them very situational picks, or you use them anyway and just drag stuff around with the winch. Neither is very appeaing. So if these trucks have room on the frame for minicranes and flatbeds and van bodies and logging racks then I say "Why not?"

Hopefully this helps with feelings of "I want to drive this truck but because it doesn't have X or can't pull Y or gets stuck so easily it stays in my garage".
